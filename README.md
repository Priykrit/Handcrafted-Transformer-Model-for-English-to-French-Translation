>Developed a **self-built** Transformer model for English-to-French translation using **TensorFlow**

>Transformer architecture: **4** encoders, **4** decoders and with masked_accuracy: **0.8351**

>Data preprocessing: normalization, cleaning, tokenization

>Engineered custom functionalities: positional encoding, self-attention

>Used dynamic learning rate scheduling strategy

>Trained using masked-loss and masked-accuracy

>Used gradio for interface creation
